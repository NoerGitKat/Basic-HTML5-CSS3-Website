					h1 About Us
					p So Wow Web Design is a small l'il company based in Your Mom's Basement. Everything we do here is so wow. We started only a year ago, but have come a long way. There still is much to do. The Internet is in dire need of wow-worthy web designs, and someone's gotta do it. 
					p Our mission is to grace the Internet with Wow-Worthy Web Designs&copy;. This is our reason for living. It is also our reason for dying, because we never have time to eat or sleep. Eating and sleeping is for wimps.
